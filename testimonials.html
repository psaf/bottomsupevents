              <p>We have hired Bottoms Up Events to bar-tend at our last several cocktail parties. From first contact, they are professional, answering emails quickly and showing up on time and in professional attire. They are organized in setting up his work area, helpful in lending a hand with food service if need be, and friendly and interactive with party guests. If the party is hopping, they offer to extend their work hours; they clean up and organize everything before they leave. Working with Bottoms Up Events is always a pleasure.</p>

              <p>We were very pleased with the prompt follow up during the contracting stage and the amazing service we received at our event. Bottom's up provided both bartending services as well as food serving services.  They were very professional and all of our guests (there were many) were very impressed with the service.  We would recommend them to our friends and family and will definitely call on them again.</p>

              <p>We've had Erika bartend two of our parties so far and each one turned out fantastic thanks to her energy and ability to keep the party flowing. Our guests were impressed with the variety of drinks and service provided. It really makes a difference to have Erika help you with your event, she really does allow you to "Be a guest at your own party!"</p>

              <p>Erika and her staff have helped at two of our parties and will continue to do so at every event we host. The bartender and server went above and beyond, from greeting our guests at the door, taking their coats, providing them with drinks, replenishing our table of appetizers, and even cleaning up before they left! The staff has been courteous, helpful, social and energetic, it truly makes hosting a party must more relaxing and enjoyable.</p>
